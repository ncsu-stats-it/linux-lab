You need to modify the sshd config file to allow root logins.

$ sudo -s
#
{modify} /etc/ssh/sshd_config
{change} PermitRootLogin no
{to}     PermitRootLogin yes
[Save]
# systemctl restart sshd.service

If you know the root password try to ssh in as root.
# ssh root@localhost
-- Did it work?
# exit
$ ssh localhost
-- Login with your password?
-- Did it work
$ exit (leaving ssh login)
$ exit (logoff)

If you do not know root password continue to step 02. At least you can ssh into the machine with your ID.
