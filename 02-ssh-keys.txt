You need to create ssh keys for root user.

First create keys for your user to verify they work with ssh.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
{press [Enter] for all prompts.}
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls -al
$ cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
$ ssh localhost
-- Did it prompt you for a password?
-- Are you logging in with Windows or Corporate Account if yes then continue.
$ sudo -s
# cd /root/.ssh
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
{press [Enter] for all prompts.}
# cd /root/.ssh
# ls -al
# cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
# ssh root@localhost
-- Did it prompt you for a password?
# exit (exit ssh)
# rm /root/.ssh/known_hosts
# cd /root
# tar -cvzf ssh-keys.tgz .ssh
# mv ssh-keys.tgz /tmp/
# chmod 777 /tmp/ssh-keys.tgz
# exit
$ scp /tmp/ssh-keys.tgz labXX:
  -- Repeat above command for every lab machine you have.   
  -- Once done for every lab machine.
$ ssh labXX
  $ sudo -s
  # cd /root
  # tar -xvzf /home/$user/ssh-keys.tgz
  # exit
  $ exit
-- Repeat above commands for every lab machine you have.   
$ sudo -s
# ssh labXX
  # exit
-- Repeat above commands for every lab machine you have.   
# scp .ssh/known_hosts root@labXX:.ssh/
-- Repeat above commands for every lab machine you have.
